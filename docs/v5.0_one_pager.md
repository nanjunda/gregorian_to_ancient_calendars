# v5.0 One-Pager: AI-Powered Panchanga Insights

## Vision
Transform the Hindu Panchanga Converter from a calculation tool into an **Interactive Wisdom Engine**. Version 5.0 will leverage Generative AI to bridge the gap between traditional Panchanga nomenclature, modern astrophysics, and Indian mythology.

## The Mechanics: The Astronomical Configuration
The conversion process captures a unique celestial "snapshot". Here is how the key elements are derived:

### 1. Samvatsara (The 60-Year Jovian Cycle)
Unlike the Gregorian year which counts from a fixed religious **epoch**, the **Samvatsara** is tied to the mean position of **Jupiter**. It takes approximately 12 years for Jupiter to orbit the Sun; a full cycle of 5 such orbits (60 years) forms the Samvatsara cycle. The specific name identifies the current phase of this **jovian** era.

### 2. Masa (The Lunar Month)
While the Western calendar uses fixed-length solar months, a **Masa** is derived from the Moon's relationship with the Sun:
*   **Derivation**: A Masa starts at the moment of the **New Moon (Amavasya)**. The month is named based on which Zodiac sign (Rashi) the Sun is in when that New Moon occurs.
*   **Gregorian Mapping**: Because lunar months (approx. 29.5 days) are shorter than solar months, the start of a Masa "drifts" relative to the Gregorian calendar.

## Core Features

### 1. The "Deep Insight" Navigator
A new interactive link under the dashboard opens a page where AI provides a narrative breakdown of the specific **Astronomical Configuration**.

### 2. Interactive Glossary (Bubble Help)
To make advanced concepts accessible to students, we will implement **Hover Tooltips (Bubble Help)**:
*   **Feature**: Terms like *epoch*, *jovian*, *precession*, and *sidereal* will be highlighted.
*   **User Action**: Hovering or tapping the term reveals a simple, student-friendly definition in a floating bubble.
*   **Benefit**: Learning happens in context without forcing the user to leave the page.

### 3. Dual-Layer AI Explanations
The AI provides insights through a "Scientist's Note" and a "Sage's Tale" (Mythology).

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Flexible AI Wrapper (`ai_engine.py`)
A **Provider-Agnostic Wrapper** using Google Gemini Flash 1.5 as the primary driver, allowing for future model swaps.

### 2. Simplification (No Caching)
As requested, we will skip intelligent caching for v5.0 to ensure a streamlined cloud deployment. Every insight request will be generated in real-time.

### 3. New Components
*   **[NEW] `templates/insights.html`**: The dedicated AI explanation page.
*   **[NEW] `static/css/tooltips.css`**: Styles for the bubble help system.
*   **[NEW] `utils/ai_engine.py`**: The AI integration layer.

## User Review Required
1.  Does the addition of bubble help for terms like "jovian" and "epoch" correctly address the educational needs of the students?
2.  I am ready to begin the implementation of the `ai_engine.py` and the tooltip system.
