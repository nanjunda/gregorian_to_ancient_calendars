# One-Pager: Interactive Education Module (v4.2)

## Vision
To advance the "Cosmic Context" by moving from static visualizations to **fully interactive 3D simulations**. Version 4.2 empowers students to manipulate the cosmos—rotating the solar system, tracing the Earth's wobble, and visualizing abstract concepts like Lunar Nodes directly in the browser.

---

## Core Features (v4.2)

### 1️⃣ Interactive 3D Visual Suite
Three specialized modules built with **Three.js** to demystify complex astronomical mechanics:
- **Zodiac Stadium (`/visuals/zodiac`)**: A 3D heliocentric model surrounded by a cylindrical "Zodiac Wall". Enables users to see how planetary positions relative to Earth project onto specific Zodiac signs.
- **Precession Top (`/visuals/precession`)**: A "Spinning Top" simulation of Earth. Visualizes the 26,000-year axial wobble, tracing the path between Polaris and Vega. includes a coordinate-correct "Cone of Time".
- **Lunar Nodes (`/visuals/lunar-nodes`)**: A geometric visualization of the Moon's 5° orbital tilt intersecting the Ecliptic plane, explicitly identifying RAHU and KETU.

### 2️⃣ Integrated Student Guide
- **Structure**: A standalone `/guide` route implementing a "scroll-telling" experience.
- **Integration**: Embeds the 3D visuals via isolated `<iframe>` components to ensure performance and style isolation.
- **Content**: Simplified, high-impact text tailored for high school students, replacing "Vedic" jargon with "Astronomical" concepts where appropriate.

## Architecture

```
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Client (Browser)|       |    Flask Server   |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
|                   |       |                   |
| 1. GET /guide     | <---> |  Serve guide.html |
|                   |       |                   |
| 2. Embed <iframe> |       |                   |
|    - src=/visuals/| <---> |  Serve templates/ |
|      zodiac       |       |  zodiac_visual.html
|                   |       |                   |
| 3. Execute JS     |       |                   |
|    (Three.js)     |       |                   |
|    - GPU Rendering|       |                   |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
```

- **Client-Side Rendering**: All 3D logic is executed in the user's browser using WebGL. The server only provides the static HTML/JS shell.
- **Stateless**: No user data is required or stored for these visualizations.
- **Performance**: 
    - Low-poly 3D primitives used for fast loading.
    - specialized `CanvasTexture` sprites for crisp text labels without external font files.

---

## Deployment Strategy
- **Standard**: `sudo ./deploy.sh`
- **Requirements**: No new backend dependencies. Front-end relies on CDN-hosted Three.js (r128).
- **Compatibility**: Verified on Chrome, Firefox, Safari (Mobile & Desktop).

---

## Future Roadmap (v5.0)
- **Real-Time Data**: Feed live ephemeris data into the 3D models to show *current* positions.
- **VR Support**: Enable WebVR for immersive "Planetarium Mode".
