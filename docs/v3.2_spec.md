# One-Pager: Hindu Panchanga v3.2 Features

## Goal
Release Version 3.2 with astrological enhancements, security upgrades, and operational improvements.

## New Features

### 1. Rashi (Moon Sign) & Lagna (Ascendant)
-   **Functionality**: Calculate and display the specific Moon Sign (Rashi) and Ascendant (Lagna) for the requested time/location.
-   **Backend**: Use Sidereal Longitude of Moon and Horizon/Ecliptic intersection.
-   **UI**: specific rows in the result table.
-   **Languages**: EN, KN, SA support.
-   **Logic**:
    *   *Rashi*: `int(moon_lon / 30.0) % 12`
    *   *Lagna*: Calculate intersection of Ecliptic & Horizon -> Sidereal Longitude -> Zodiac Index.

### 2. HTTPS Support (Security)
-   **Goal**: Secure data in transmission using SSL/TLS.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Generate **Self-Signed Certificates** (since we are using a raw IP).
    -   Update Nginx configuration to listen on port **443** (HTTPS) and redirect HTTP traffic.
    -   *Note: Browsers will show a "Not Secure" warning for self-signed certs on an IP, but encryption will work.*

### 3. Privacy Note
-   **Goal**: Reassure users regarding their data.
-   **UI**: Add a visible footer or note below the form: *"Privacy Note: All calculations happen in real-time. No location or personal data is stored on our servers."*

### 4. Hourly Log Rotation
-   **Goal**: Prevent disk space usage from growing and clear logs frequently.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Configure `logrotate` for Nginx and Gunicorn.
    -   Schedule: Hourly rotation.
    -   Retention: Keep only last 1-2 hours (or effectively reset).

## Verification Plan
1.  **Astrology**: Compare Rashi/Lagna with reference software.
2.  **Security**: Access via `https://<IP>` and confirm encrypted connection.
3.  **Privacy**: Verify footer text visibility.
4.  **Ops**: Wait 1 hour and verify logs have rotated/cleared.
