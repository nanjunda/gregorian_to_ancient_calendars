# One-Pager: The "Cosmic Context" Feature (Educational Module)

## Goal
Bridge the gap between modern astronomy and Vedic astrology by visually demonstrating that a user's birth is a precise astronomical configuration. The aim is to educate and spark curiosity in users unfamiliar with Indian astronomy.

## Concept: "Where were the Stars when you were born?"
Instead of just showing abstract terms like "Ashwini Nakshatra", we will show the **physical reality** of that statement. We will render a simplified 2D sky map showing the Moon's actual position near the specific star system (constellation) at the moment of birth.

## Proposed Features

### 1. The "Sky Shot" (Visual Sky Map)
*   **What**: A generated image or canvas rendering of the night sky at the user's specific birth time and location.
*   **Details**:
    *   Show the **Ecliptic Path** (the road of the planets).
    *   Show the **Moon** in its correct phase and position.
    *   **Crucial**: Highlight the boundries of the 27 Nakshatras (Stars) in the background.
    *   **Educational Overlay**: A line connecting the Moon to its specific Nakshatra, e.g., "Moon is here -> inside the 'Lion' constellation (Magha)".

### 2. "Did You Know?" Astronomical Fact Cards
*   **What**: Dynamic fact cards that explain the math behind the result.
*   **Examples**:
    *   If Tithi is *Purnima*: "At your birth, the Sun and Moon were exactly 180 degrees apart, facing each other across Earth."
    *   If Nakshatra is *Rohini*: "The Moon was passing near the reddish star Aldebaran (Rohini) in the Taurus constellation."
    *   Explain **Sidereal vs. Tropical**: "Unlike Western signs, we look at the *actual* stars. That's why your sign might be different!"

### 3. The "Solar System Top-Down" View
*   **What**: A mini-widget showing a heliocentric (Sun-centered) view of the solar system.
*   **Educational Value**: Helps users visualize planetary alignment. "See? Jupiter and Mars were on the same side of the Sun!"

## Implementation Technicalities
*   **Backend**: We are already using `skyfield` and `JPL Ephemeris`. This data is readily available. We just need to expose the raw XYZ coordinates or Angles.
*   **Frontend**: Use a library like `Chart.js` (Scatter plot) or a specialized lightweight astronomy JS lib to render the positions.

## Recommendation
I recommend starting with **Feature 2 (Fact Cards)** and **Feature 1 (Simplified Sky Map)**. This turns the application into a "Cosmic Storyteller" rather than just a calculator.
