## Welcome, Time Traveler!
Most of us know our "Star Sign," but that's just a tiny piece of the puzzle. The sky is a giant clock, and for thousands of years, civilizations mastered reading it without electronics. This guide introduces you to the **Hindu Panchanga**, a digital time machine that uses NASA data to reconstruct the ancient sky.

## 1. The Two Clocks of Earth
Every culture has a "Map of Time." 
- **Western Calendar (Solar)**: Tuned to the **Seasons**. It stays aligned with the Sun's journey from Spring to Spring.
- **Hindu Panchanga (Luni-Solar-Sidereal)**: Tuned to the **Stars**. It tracks where planets *actually* are in the galaxy, not just which season it is.

## 2. The 5 Limbs (Angas)
"Panchanga" means five limbs. Every moment has:
1.  **Vara**: The Weekday.
2.  **Tithi**: Lunar Day (based on the Sun-Moon angle).
3.  **Nakshatra**: The Moon's star mansion (27 sub-divisions).
4.  **Yoga**: The mathematical sum of solar and lunar longitudes.
5.  **Karana**: Half of a Tithi (the active interval).

## 3. The Cosmic Stadium (Zodiac)
Imagine the planets as runners on a field. The Zodiac signs are giant billboards on the stadium wall. 
- **Rashi**: The 12 zones of the sky (Aries/Mesha, etc.).
- **Interactive**: In the digital guide, you can rotate the 3D stadium to see how Earth views these "billboards."

## 4. The Great Wobble (Precession)
Earth spins like a slowing top. It won't point to the same North Star forever! 
- **Precession**: A 25,800-year cycle.
- **Ayanamsha**: The 24-degree drift between the stars and our seasons caused by this wobble. This is why your "Western" sign is usually different from your "Hindu" sign.

## 5. The Shadow Planets (Rahu & Ketu)
They aren't physical rocks, but **mathematical danger zones**.
- **Lunar Nodes**: Points where the Moon's tilted orbit cuts through the Earth's path.
- **Rahu**: The North crossing.
- **Ketu**: The South crossing.
- **Eclipses**: ONLY happen when the Sun and Moon meet at these specific points.

## 6. The Celestial Race
Why is Saturn "slow"?
- **The Moon**: Finishes a lap in 27 days.
- **Jupiter**: Finishes a lap in 12 years.
- **Saturn**: Finishes a lap in 30 years!
Planets in the outer lanes simply have much more ground to cover.

## 7. The Sun's Swing (Uttarayana/Dakshinayana)
The Sun doesn't stay in the same place. It swings North for 6 months and South for 6 months. This "swing" is what creates our seasons and changes the length of our days.

## 8. Retrograde: The Optical Illusion
Planets **never** actually move backward. It's an illusion that happens when Earth (in a faster orbit) passes a slower planet, making it *look* like it's looping backward against the stars.

## 🔐 Privacy & Precision
- **NASA JPL Data**: We use the same math NASA uses for satellite launches.
- **Stealth Mode**: No data is saved. No database exists. Your cosmic details vanish the moment you close the tab.

**Welcome to the true sky.**
